        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>What are some secrets you've learned from your work place? What unbelievable things have you seen or witnessed?</p> 
      	<p>If you work at any job long enough, you are going to encounter all sorts of bizarre and absurd scenarios.
          But this isn't surprising; we live in a world where life is complex and it's not always possible to make
          rational, intelligent decisions every waking hour. We tend to create actions that force us to justify it later on,
          which is pathway for all kinds of disasters. Accounting, engineering, sales... it doesn't matter what field you
          pick, chances are you'll find people trying to make money while doing as little work as possible.</p> 
        </p>
        <p>On the bright side, it leads to some interesting stories, and this site is here to collect them so
          that we read and be astonished at the underlying absurdities of the work force.</p>
